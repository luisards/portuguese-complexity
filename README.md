### Datasets

- NLI-PT (https://clul.ulisboa.pt/en/recurso/portuguese-native-language-identification-dataset)
- Readability NLP Portuguese (https://github.com/gazzola/corpus_readability_nlp_portuguese)

### Feature extraction method
CTAP (https://sifnos.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ctap/)
* 434 linguistic complexity features have been implemented for Portuguese, 
  which can be classified as lexical, morphological, monphosyntactic, syntactic and cohesive features
* The Portuguese features have not yet been released

### Goal
- Analyze and identify criterial features in the data
- Describe proficiency levels quantitavely
- Determine a non-reductionist linguistic complexity rating system for individualized readabily classification
