# portuguese-complexity

### Datasets

- NLI-PT (https://clul.ulisboa.pt/en/recurso/portuguese-native-language-identification-dataset)
- Córpus de Complexidade Textual para Estágios Escolares do Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (https://github.com/gazzola/corpus_readability_nlp_portuguese)

### Feature extraction method
CTAP (https://sifnos.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ctap/)
* 434 linguistic complexity features have been implemented for Portuguese, 
  which can be classified as lexical, morphological, monphosyntactic, syntactic and cohesive features
* The Portuguese features have not yet been released

### Goal
- Model proficiency and readability with linguistic complexity measures
- Verify whether the data corroborates the concept of static levels and criterial features
