# Assessment of Text Readability and Learner Proficiency with Linguistic Complexity: The Case of Portuguese

### Corpora

- NLI-PT (https://clul.ulisboa.pt/en/recurso/portuguese-native-language-identification-dataset)
- Córpus de Complexidade Textual para Estágios Escolares do Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (https://github.com/gazzola/corpus_readability_nlp_portuguese)

### Feature extraction method
CTAP (https://sifnos.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/ctap/)
* 465 linguistic complexity measures have been implemented for Portuguese, 
  belonging to the surface, lexical, morphological, monphological, syntactic and discursive domains
* The measures for Portuguese analysis have not yet been released

### Goal
- Model proficiency and readability with linguistic complexity measures
- Verify whether the data corroborates the concept of static levels and criterial features for both constructs
